Task tracker

This is a comprehensive task management system that empowers users to efficiently organize their tasks. This full-stack application combines the robustness of Spring Boot on the backend, the responsiveness of React.js on the frontend, and the reliability of MySQL as the database.

Tech Stack

Client: React js BootStrap Server: Java, Spring Boot Database: MySQL

Architecture

The Task Management System follows a client-server architecture, with a backend built using Java and Spring Boot serving as the server-side application. The frontend is developed using React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. MySQL is used as the database to store task-related data.

Modules

Backend: Contains the Java and Spring Boot application responsible for handling business logic and database operations.

Frontend: Includes the React application responsible for providing a user interface for interacting with the system.

Database: Contains the MySQL database schema and scripts for creating and managing the database.

Backend Setup

Clone the repository.

Navigate to the backend directory.

Configure the MySQL database connection in application.properties.

Run the Spring Boot application using your IDE or the command line.


 Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory.

Install dependencies using npm install.

Start the React application using npm start


Database Setup


install MYSQL database and workbenchDB

Execute the database schema script provided in the database directory to create the necessary tables.

Update the database connection details in the backend application properties.
